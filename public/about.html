<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Moke Elvis, currently learning full stack web development from Udemy Academy. It has been a hard process 
  but like the saying goes "nothing good comes easily" it has been a hell of a journey for me, for me learning alone all 
by myself with no one learning around me kind of makes it more difficult and boring but the good news is my lecturer 
"Dr. Angela Yu" has been doing a great job with her step by step learning tutorials making it effortlessly for me to understand 
all that she have thought me without further research or tutorials.</p>

<p>I'm still in this journey to become an expert full stack web developer which might take some days, months or years to become 
  a pro in web development. I'm determine that someday I will achieve my goals just like I did when learning Graphics Design
  few years back. The truth is my previous knowledge about some computer applications and understanding my desktop environment
  has helped me alot in navigating through VS Studio while learning this course, I'm becoming more familiar with web development.</p>

<p>I'm here to put in my best just has I hope for the best outcome to be one of the world full stack top web developer, I'm looking forward 
  to build the first of my many professional web pages. Do reach out to me when you see my works some day anywhere in the internet or mobile 
  applications, I will always be at your service to give you the best websites but until then shalom.
